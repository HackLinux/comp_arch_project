Info: Running Quartus II 64-Bit TimeQuest Timing Analyzer
    Info: Version 13.0.0 Build 156 04/24/2013 SJ Full Version
    Info: Processing started: Sat Mar 21 17:46:18 2015
Info: Command: quartus_sta Project -c Project
Info: qsta_default_script.tcl version: #1
Info (11104): Parallel Compilation has detected 8 hyper-threaded processors. However, the extra hyper-threaded processors will not be used by default. Parallel Compilation will use 4 of the 4 physical processors detected instead.
Info (21076): High junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '85'.
Info (21076): Low junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '0'.
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'Project.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info (332142): No user constrained base clocks found in the design. Calling "derive_clocks -period 1.0"
Info (332105): Deriving Clocks
    Info (332105): create_clock -period 1.000 -name clk clk
Info (332143): No user constrained clock uncertainty found in the design. Calling "derive_clock_uncertainty"
Info (332154): The derive_clock_uncertainty command did not apply clock uncertainty to any clock-to-clock transfers.
Info: Found TIMEQUEST_REPORT_SCRIPT_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_ANALYSIS = ON
